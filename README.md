# ME35: Robotics and Mechatronics Project
## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the ME35: Robotics and Mechatronics class at Tufts University. The goal of this project is to [briefly describe the objective of the project, e.g., "build and control a robotic arm using servo motors and Raspberry Pi to perform basic tasks"]. The project incorporates key mechatronics concepts, including motion control, sensors, and embedded systems.

Features
Robot design: Explain the design of the robot (e.g., "A robotic arm with 4 DOF using MG996R servo motors controlled by a Raspberry Pi").
Control system: Python code to control servos using PWM signals with the adafruit_servokit library.
User interface: Describe if there is any control mechanism, GUI, or interaction setup.
Hardware Components
Raspberry Pi
MG996R Servo Motors (list the number and their roles)
SG90 Servo Motor (gripper)
Breadboard, wires, resistors
External power supply (specify if needed)
